  ## Installation

  Clone the repository from github, all files must be present, and run 'node app.js' from the command line.
  
  ## Usage
 
  Once installed, navigate into the containing file with command line.  Run 'npm init', being sure that inquirer is installed.  Then run 'node app.js' from the command line and simply answer prompted questions.  You can add as many team members as you wish as long as you answer 'yes' to the "Do you want to add more" question.  Answering no exits the program and a completed file is rendered in 'team.html'.
